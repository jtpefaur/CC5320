1. As a part of a graphic engine, there is a routine that has to fill a buffer with green colour
before printing the next frame. The screen is ROWSxCOLUMNS pixels.
	(a) Analyze rgb.c code.
	(b) Find the first level cache misses and the second cache level misses.
	(c) Propose an optimization so we can better exploit the spatial locality of the data.
	(d) Propose a new version that also reduces the number of memory accesess.

2. MANDATORY: Optimize rgb.c in order to reach the server's threshold.

1. pi.c program compute the first 10000 decimals of the  number.
	(a) Look at the source code of the program, and in particular, study the source code of routine DIVIDE.
	(b) Profile and analyze the program behavior.
	(c) Modify the code specializing the routine/s you consider necessary and check that the output of the 
	new version is the same as the original version.
	Hint: Specilize the code using memoization.
	(d) Profile the new version of the program and compare it with the profile of the original code.
	(e) Which speed-up have you obtained?

2. MANDATORY: Optimize pi.c in order to reach the server's threshold.
